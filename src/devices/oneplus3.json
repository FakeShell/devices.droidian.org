It is important to note that firmware is device specific, so be sure to pick the correct one from `https://github.com/nvertigo/firmware-3t/tree/master/archive` Now in recovery, flash the LineageOS 16 treble build from #{3}. After installed, boot into LineageOS and confirm everything is working. Lastly, boot back into recovery, go to `Wipe` -> `Advanced Wipe` -> Select everything except `Vendor` and `USB-OTG`, then `Swipe to Wipe`. Then reboot back into recovery. Now your device is treblized and you can proceed to install Droidian."
