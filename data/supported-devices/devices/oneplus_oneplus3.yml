  notes:
    - title: Default password
      text: The default password is `1234`.
    - title: Unlocking SIM
      text: After entering a pin code to unlock your SIM card, you need to restart the Settings application to get access to the Mobile Network settings because the menu doesn't update automatically.
    - title: APN Settings
      text: "Mobile data needs an APN to be set up from Settings -> Mobile Network -> Access Point Names. You can get the apn settings for your carrier here: https://apn.how"
    - title: Empty APN dialog
      text: "If you get an empty Access Points window even after you have entered the info, ofono is not working properly. Run the command 'sudo systemctl restart ofono.service' to solve the issue."
    - title: Dual SIM
      text: Dual SIM functionality is currently not implemented in Phosh so only one SIM works at the moment.
    - title: Offline Charging
      text: When powered off, plugging in a charger will power on the device. If you experience a flashing screen, reboot to solve the issue. If the phone is powered on manually or rebooted, there won't be any screen flashing.
    - title: Camera
      text: Camera doesn't yet work in Droidian or Waydroid.
    - title: GPU
      text: Currently GPU only works partially in Droidian, but in Waydroid it works perfectly.
